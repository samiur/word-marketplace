        <h1>How to Use the Marketplace</h1>
        <p class="lead text-left">
          <strong>Test the value of your words.</strong> Type your word into the box on our <a href="index.html">homepage</a>, and see if it made the list of most common nonprofit words. If it appears on the list, think critically if it’s a word your organization should use.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-left">
          <strong>Review the lists.</strong> Read over the <a href="results.html">results</a> from the The Marketplace of Words research. You’ll get a good idea of which words nonprofits are overusing, and how many nonprofits are overusing them.

        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <p class="lead text-left">
          <strong>Focus on verbs.</strong> Some nouns nonprofits simply need to use. <em>Board</em>, <em>school</em> and <em>art</em> may be necessary, depending on the nature of your organization. Adjectives and adverbs should be looked at closely, but the most important part of your sentence is your verb. I know your amazing organization does more than <em>give</em>, <em>work</em>, or <em>provide</em>. Show the world what that is!
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-left">
          <strong>Relax your language.</strong> We’re often taught that formal language should be used to convey professionalism. And we were taught wrong. Laid-back language will connect with most (if not all) audiences. Ask yourself: Would I say this out loud in casual conversation? If the answer is no, rethink your word choices. Write like you speak.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-left">
          <strong>Get specific.</strong> What do you actually mean when you say <em>community</em>? How big is it and who is a part of it? There are so many methods of <em>outreach</em>; which are you referring to? If questions like this can be asked, chances are you’re using words that aren’t specific enough. Just because you know exactly which <em>community</em> you mean, don’t expect that your audience will.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-left">
          <strong>Talk about your audience.</strong> Based on the pronouns nonprofits use, it’s clear they’re talking about themselves too much. <em>We</em> do this at <em>our</em> organization. Try involving your audience with some <em>yous</em>. Because without support from outside your organization, your organization wouldn’t exist.
